## 🧠 About Me

I am a **Software Engineering student** and **Full Stack Developer** with a focus on building secure, scalable, and data-driven systems. Currently, I am an Intern at **DPOnet**, a leading platform for **LGPD (Data Privacy) compliance**, where I contribute to automating complex regulatory workflows and data protection systems.

While I have a strong foundation in **Java and Spring Boot**, I am currently delivering high-impact solutions using **Ruby on Rails and React/TypeScript**. I am a firm believer in **Software Craftsmanship**, consistently applying **SOLID, Clean Code, and Clean Architecture** to ensure long-term maintainability.
